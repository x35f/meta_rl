# Meta Reinforcement Learning Re-implementations for [Unstable Baselines](https://github.com/x35f/unstable_Baselines)

## Stable Algorithms (Runnable and has equivalent performance to that of the original implementations)
* [Efficient Off-policy Meta-learning via Probabilistic Context Variables](http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.08254) (PEARL)

## Quick Start
* Requires the [Unstable Baselines](https://github.com/x35f/unstable_Baselines) parent module to run. See [Unstable Baselines](https://github.com/x35f/unstable_Baselines) for more details.
 
## Results
* The Tensorboard logs of some experimental runs has been included in the ``results`` directory.
* Test Machine Information
	* Ubuntu 20.04
	* Intel I9-12900KF
	* NVIDIA RTX 3080
	* Crucial DDR5 96 GigaBytes
